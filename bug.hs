The issue lies in the usage of `undefined` within a Haskell function. Haskell's type system is strong and static, and `undefined` represents an uninitialized value. When the function encounters a branch that returns `undefined`, it doesn't necessarily result in a runtime error immediately. Instead, it propagates the `undefined` value, which often leads to unexpected behavior or runtime crashes later in the program's execution when the `undefined` value is used in an operation that requires a defined value.
